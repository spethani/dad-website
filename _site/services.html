    <h3>Estate Planning</h3>
    <p>One of the planning avenues that are often overlooked by many until it is too late is Estate Planning and in fact can be the most cost-effective means of saving additional money for your heirs. Such planning goes well beyond an annual gifting program, extending to the creation of family limited partnerships, trusts and charitable foundations, among many other planning opportunities. We propose a comprehensive plan, using appropriate tools available, in conjunction with asset protection to reduce estate and gift taxes to the greatest extent possible while still achieving various other goals that you may have. Our firm is staffed by a cadre of seasoned professionals who are highly qualified, and have spent years guiding clients to manage their finances thus bridging the chasm between opportunity and reality. We provide both a comprehensive array of resources and the personal touch of a trusted tax advisor. We look forward to an opportunity of working for you.</p>
