<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The 2nd round of PPP will commence on Jan 11th for first-time borrowers and Jan 13th for second-time borrowers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Applicants should have utilized all the money they received the first time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Revenue needs to have decreased by at least 25% in 2020 compared to the same quarter in 2019. For example, Q2 2020 (April, May, June 2020 Revenue) vs. Q2 2019  (April, May, June 2019 Revenue) must have decreased 25% Year Over Year. 1 Quarter is a minimum. Revenue reduction can also be the full calendar year of 2020 vs. 2019.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Payroll can be calculated in 3 ways: (1) 2019 calendar year, (2) 2020 calendar year, (3) past 12 months.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Restaurants, hotels, and other businesses categorized under NAICS code 72 will be eligible to receive 3.5x their average monthly payroll.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most other businesses are eligible to receive 2.5 times their average monthly payroll.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For Loans of over 150K, additional documentation will be required.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PPP “second round” loans are to people who have less than 300 employees, and most businesses, including sole proprietors and contractors, qualify if their revenue decreased by 25% in any quarter.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="forgiveness-of-loans">Forgiveness of loans</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Borrowers are still required to spend at least 60% of the funds on payroll over a covered period of either 8 or 24 weeks to receive full forgiveness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other 40% may be used on eligible costs, including certain mortgage expenses, rent, and utility payments.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="ppp2-new-allowances-for-additional-expenses">PPP2: New allowances for additional expenses</h5>

<p>Under the renewed program, the list of eligible non-payroll expenses has been expanded to include four new categories, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Costs for personal protective equipment and adaptive investments that help a PPP loan recipient comply with federal and/or health and safety guidelines related to COVID-19;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Outlays for on software, cloud computing, human resources, and accounting needs;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any spending not covered by insurance that is related to property damage due to public disturbances that occurred during 2020;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spending to suppliers that covered costs essential to the business operations at the time the outlay occurred. For instance, restaurants’ purchases of perishable goods can now qualify.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="important-tax-changes">Important tax changes</h5>

<p>An important change outlined in the new regulation is that forgiven PPP loans will be completely tax-free. Any usually-tax-deductible business expenses paid for with PPP loans will also continue to be deductible.</p>
