- Applicants should have utilized all the money they received the first time.

- Revenue needs to have decreased by at least 25% in 2020 compared to the same quarter in 2019. For example, Q2 2020 (April, May, June 2020 Revenue) vs. Q2 2019  (April, May, June 2019 Revenue) must have decreased 25% Year Over Year. 1 Quarter is a minimum. Revenue reduction can also be the full calendar year of 2020 vs. 2019.

- Restaurants, hotels, and other businesses categorized under NAICS code 72 will be eligible to receive 3.5x their average monthly payroll. 

- Most other businesses are eligible to receive 2.5 times their average monthly payroll. 

- For Loans of over 150K, additional documentation will be required.  

- PPP “second round” loans are to people who have less than 300 employees, and most businesses, including sole proprietors and contractors, qualify if their revenue decreased by 25% in any quarter.

##### Forgiveness of loans

- Borrowers are still required to spend at least 60% of the funds on payroll over a covered period of either 8 or 24 weeks to receive full forgiveness.

- The other 40% may be used on eligible costs, including certain mortgage expenses, rent, and utility payments.

##### PPP2: New allowances for additional expenses

Under the renewed program, the list of eligible non-payroll expenses has been expanded to include four new categories, including:

- Costs for personal protective equipment and adaptive investments that help a PPP loan recipient comply with federal and/or health and safety guidelines related to COVID-19;

- Outlays for on software, cloud computing, human resources, and accounting needs;

- Any spending not covered by insurance that is related to property damage due to public disturbances that occurred during 2020;

- Spending to suppliers that covered costs essential to the business operations at the time the outlay occurred. For instance, restaurants’ purchases of perishable goods can now qualify.

##### Important tax changes

An important change outlined in the new regulation is that forgiven PPP loans will be completely tax-free. Any usually-tax-deductible business expenses paid for with PPP loans will also continue to be deductible.
